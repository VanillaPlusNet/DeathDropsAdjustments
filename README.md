# DeathDropsAdjustments

## About

This is a Minecraft plugin that stops loot from spreading out everywhere, and delays totems dropping after death.

Could be used for servers that want to:

- Revert death drops to how they were in 1.20.1 and below, globally.
- Delay totems dropping after a player dies, with an adjustable WorldGaurd flag, so that players can pick up the useful loot before their inventory is full of totems.

Requires [WorldGaurd](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) for setting the totem drop delay flag.

## WorldGaurd Flags

`totem-pickup-delay` - Set to the number of seconds that you want totems to be delayed before they drop. During this time a small animation plays where the player died, showing that totems are about to drop there.
